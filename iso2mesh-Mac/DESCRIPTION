Title: A 3D surface and volumetric mesh generator for MATLAB/Octave

Maintainer: Qianqian Fang <fangqq@gmail.com>
Description: Iso2Mesh is a MATLAB/Octave-based mesh generation toolbox,
 designed for easy creation of high quality surface and
 tetrahedral meshes from 3D volumetric images. It contains
 a rich set of mesh processing scripts/programs, working
 either independently or interacting with external free
 meshing utilities. Iso2Mesh toolbox can directly convert
 a 3D image stack, including binary, segmented or gray-scale
 images such as MRI or CT scans, into quality volumetric
 meshes. This makes it particularly suitable for multi-modality
 medical imaging data analysis and multi-physics modeling.
 Iso2Mesh is cross-platform and is compatible with both MATLAB
 and GNU Octave.
