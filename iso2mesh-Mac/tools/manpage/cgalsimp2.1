.SH NAME
cgalsimp2 \- triangular surface mesh simplification
.SH SYNOPSIS
cgalsimp2 input.off keepratio
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cgalsimp2 utility is a surface mesh simplification utility 
built on the CGAL library (http://cgal.org). This tool utilizes
the Lindstromâ€“Turk algorithm and decimate a surface mesh into
a coarser downsampled surface. The output mesh is stored in
a file named "out.off".

Please see https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Surface_mesh_simplification/
for details regarding the underlying algorithm.
.SH OPTIONS
This program accepts the following input parameters:
.TP
\fBinput.off\fR|(required)
The input surface mesh in the OFF format
.TP
\fBkeepratio\fR|(required)
A 0-1 floating point number denoting the percentage of edges 
that will be preserved (1-keepratio is the percentage of edges 
that will be decimated. If keepratio is negative, it triggers 
the "LindstromTurk placement" policy; otherwise, it uses a 
mid-point placement policy by clapsing an edge to its mid-point.
