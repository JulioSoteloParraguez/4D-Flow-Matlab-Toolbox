# 4D-Flow-Matlab-Toolbox
This code was developed by Dr. Julio Sotelo, as part of his PhD thesis and also his postdoctoral research, guided by the professors Dr. Sergio Uribe and Dr. Daniel Hurtado, from the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. It is also part of the contribution developed by the Center for Biomedical Imaging (www.mri.cl) and Nucleo Milenio CardioMR (https://cardiomr.cl/). We have developed a methodology for the non-invasive quantification of hemodynamics and geometrical parameters from 4D flow data sets based on Finite Elements methods. 

The application run on Windows and macOS, it can also be used in Linux. To generate the FEM mesh we make use of iso2mesh opensource toolbox (http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?Home). You need to load the 4D Flow MRI data set as structure file MATLAB (See the document USER-GUIDE-4D-FLOW-APP). If you have some problems to create this structure file, please send me an email to: julio.sotelo@uv.cl or jasotelo@uc.cl.
